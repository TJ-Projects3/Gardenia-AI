# Gardenia-AI
Garden AI, a garden assistant that helps gardener of all levels grow and learn about plants and diagnose issues, or diseases they might have. By using photo and voice recognition technology, the assistant can quickly recognize different plants and detect potential problems, such as pests, diseases, or watering issues, providing tailored advice. Additionally, the assistant will feature an inventory system that tracks which plants users have and monitors their progress and eventually their care routine, such as watering schedules, ensuring that plants get the attention they need.
